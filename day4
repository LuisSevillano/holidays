after the fact of sleep almost ten hours I had a breakfast of toast w tomatoes and garlic, some cookies and orange juice. Then drove along the whole natural park stopping at many beaches. I had lunch in a typical beach bar where I had local fishes, beers, grilled vegetables and a big one salad. Then drove back. I arrive early so I decided to have a walk to an old castle tower near the village. Its a really nice view from.
