another damn windy day but no problem. Holidays is just for relax, so grab your book and read. For sure I had a really amazing lunch of local fish, red prawn, gilt-head bream, steamed mussels and delicius salad. More relax, and late in the afternoon I decided to have a walk. Walkin to west by the sea side across a creepy old factories instalations. mmmmmm I really like thath shit. And walk back. Late night pizza
