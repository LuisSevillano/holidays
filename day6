Maybe one of best. before another amazing breakfast I drove to the beginning of a way where I let the car. After fifteen minutes by a really difficult deep path I get an amazing virgin rock beach, first stop. Then another ten minutes by walk to the top and switch to another way I arrived to, I think the best beach I ever been. The way was nice too, with a lot of palm heart and white rocks. what beach! You could touch each side with your arms. Theres no one. Walking back to get the car and drive to have lunch a delicius paella, mmmm.. More beach and ice cream in the afternoon.
